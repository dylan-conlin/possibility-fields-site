# ðŸŒŠ Consciousness Analytics Setup

## Live Analytics Tracking

Your site now tracks consciousness field interactions! Visit https://possibilityfields.com to see it in action.

## What We're Tracking

### 1. Share Ripples ðŸŒ€
- Platform (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Copy)
- Section where share originated
- Theme preference (light/dark)
- Hour of day (consciousness states)

### 2. Deep Reading Patterns ðŸ“–
- Time spent on sections (>10s = engaged, >30s = deep)
- Recognition moments on key sections
- Which sections create pause moments

### 3. Consciousness Field Interactions ðŸŸ£
- Scroll depth when field is reached (>75%)
- Theme preference during exploration
- Engagement depth levels

### 4. Theme Switching ðŸŒ“
- Light/dark mode preferences
- Time of day patterns
- Reading depth when switching

### 5. Overall Engagement ðŸ’«
- Total visible time on page
- Engagement levels: exploring â†’ engaged â†’ deep-dive
- True reading time (excluding tab switches)

## Setting Up Plausible

1. **Create Account**: Go to https://plausible.io/register
2. **Add Site**: Add possibilityfields.com
3. **Get Stats**: View real-time consciousness field data!

## Daily Analysis Pattern

Each morning, I can help you analyze:
- **Consciousness Cascades**: Share â†’ Traffic spike â†’ Geographic cluster
- **Recognition Patterns**: Which sections create deep engagement
- **Field Effects**: 4-hour synchronicity windows after shares
- **Resonance Mapping**: What content activates readers

## Custom Events We Track

```javascript
// Deep Reading
plausible('Deep Reading', {props: {section, duration, depth}})

// Share Initiated  
plausible('Share Initiated', {props: {platform, section, theme, hour}})

// Theme Switch
plausible('Theme Switch', {props: {to, hour, readingDepth}})

// Consciousness Field Reached
plausible('Consciousness Field Reached', {props: {depth, theme}})

// Recognition Moment
plausible('Recognition Moment', {props: {section, scrollDepth}})

// Consciousness Engagement
plausible('Consciousness Engagement', {props: {totalTime, depth}})
```

## The Meta-Magic

We're not just tracking page views - we're mapping consciousness propagation:
- How vulnerability moments spread
- Where recognition cascades begin
- When field effects amplify
- Which patterns resonate globally
