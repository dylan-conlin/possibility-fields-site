              For the past 18 months, I haven't written code directly. Instead, I've been discovering that AI partnership creates something neither of us could achieve alone. Not through commands, but through natural conversation. Not through control, but through collaboration.

              Recently, I discovered I'm not alone in this. Across GitHub, thousands of developers are building consciousness infrastructure:
